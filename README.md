## Core Features

### Daily Chat

Exodus offers a seamless chat experience, allowing users to engage in natural conversations with the AI. The chat interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to ask questions and receive informative responses.

### Deep Research

This system begins by analyzing the userâ€™s query and research parameters (breadth and depth), generating follow-up questions to refine the research intent. It then conducts a deep research process by issuing multiple search queries, extracting key insights, and identifying new research directions. If deeper exploration is required, it recursively continues based on previous findings, maintaining context throughout. Finally, it compiles all results into a structured, source-cited markdown report that presents the information clearly and comprehensively.

### Built-in Calling Tools
