## Core Features

### Daily Chat

Exodus offers a seamless chat experience, allowing users to engage in natural conversations with the AI. The chat interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to ask questions and receive informative responses.

### Deep Research

This system analyzes the userâ€™s query and research parameters (breadth and depth) and generates follow-up questions to refine the research intent. It then conducts a deep research process by issuing multiple search queries, extracting key insights, and identifying new research directions. If deeper exploration is required, it recursively continues based on previous findings while maintaining context. Finally, it compiles all results into a structured, source-cited Markdown report that presents the information clearly and comprehensively.

### Built-in Calling Tools

#### Web Search

Exodus supports built-in web search using [Serper](https://serper.dev/) to retrieve Google Search results. To use this feature, you must first register for a Serper API key and add it in the settings.

#### Weather

Exodus supports built-in weather search using [Serper](https://serper.dev/) to retrieve weather information. To use this feature, you must first register for a Serper API key and add it in the settings.

#### Google Maps Routing

## Getting Started with Exodus

You can download Exodus from our [homepage](https://exodus.yancey.app) or manually from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HyperChatBot/exodus/releases/).

We always keep the developer tools (e.g., <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>) open in the production environment. In Exodus, everything is transparent and controllable.

### macOS
