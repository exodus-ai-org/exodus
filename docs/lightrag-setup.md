# LightRAG Knowledge Base — Setup

Exodus's knowledge base is **optional** and powered by a **self-hosted
[LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) server that you run**. Exodus is a
client only: it pushes your documents into LightRAG and asks it for relevant
context at query time. It never runs, upgrades, or manages LightRAG, and never
creates its storage or schema — same posture as the optional Elasticsearch
integration (`docs/elasticsearch-setup.md`).

When no server URL is configured, the knowledge base is completely inert — no
tool, no behavior change.

## 1. Run the LightRAG server

Minimal `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  lightrag:
    image: ghcr.io/HKUDS/LightRAG:latest # pin a specific tag in production
    ports: ['9621:9621']
    volumes:
      - ./data/rag_storage:/app/data/rag_storage # graph + vectors + KV store
      - ./data/inputs:/app/data/inputs # uploaded source files
    env_file: .env
```

Create `.env` next to it:

```bash
PORT=9621
LIGHTRAG_API_KEY=change-me-to-a-long-secret   # Exodus sends this as X-API-Key
SUMMARY_LANGUAGE=English                        # language for entity summaries

# LLM used for entity/relationship extraction during ingestion
LLM_BINDING=openai                             # openai | ollama | azure | lollms
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
LLM_BINDING_HOST=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_BINDING_API_KEY=sk-...

# Embedding model
EMBEDDING_BINDING=openai                        # openai | ollama | lollms
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
EMBEDDING_DIM=3072
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
curl -H "X-API-Key: $LIGHTRAG_API_KEY" http://localhost:9621/health
```

> **⚠️ The embedding model and `EMBEDDING_DIM` are locked once you ingest the
> first document.** Changing either later requires wiping `./data/rag_storage`
> and re-adding every document. Pick a model you'll keep.

Ingestion costs LLM tokens on your `LLM_BINDING_API_KEY` (LightRAG runs entity
extraction over each document), and runs in the background — expect seconds to
minutes per document.

## 2. Point Exodus at it

In Exodus open **Settings → Knowledge Base**:

1. **Server URL** — `http://localhost:9621`
2. **API Key** — the `LIGHTRAG_API_KEY` from your `.env`
3. Click **Test Connection** — it reports the LLM model, embedding model, and
   current document count.
4. **Query mode** — leave on `mix` (graph + vector, best quality) unless you
   have a reason to change it.

## 3. Add documents

Under **Documents**, use **Add document** (title + text). Each document shows an
index-status badge:

| Badge         | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending       | Queued for sync to LightRAG                                                              |
| Indexing…     | LightRAG is processing it                                                                |
| Indexed       | Ready — retrieval will use it                                                            |
| Failed        | Sync or processing failed; hover for the error, then edit/re-save or use **Reindex all** |
| Needs reindex | Content changed but the sync stalled; use **Reindex all**                                |

Editing a document re-indexes it (LightRAG documents are immutable, so Exodus
deletes and re-inserts). Deleting removes it from LightRAG too.

**Reindex all** re-pushes every document — use it after first configuring the
server, or after wiping `rag_storage`.

## 4. How the AI uses it

Retrieval is a tool the model calls when a question looks like the knowledge
base might cover it (`searchKnowledgeBase`, toggleable under Settings → Built-in
Tools). LightRAG returns the retrieved context; **Exodus's own chat model
writes the answer.** It's available in both the main chat and Philharmonic
Groups. If LightRAG is unreachable, the tool reports that and the conversation
continues normally.
