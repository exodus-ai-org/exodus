 * quote it is, small and to the side of a rule, over the question. One asked
 * from the phone's Health workspace opens with the numbers it was about
 * (`splitHealth`), before any quote: drawn as a card of chips. One that
 * answers a questionnaire or a confirmation opens with its answer fence
 * (`splitAnswer`): drawn as a card — the block's title, then the answers,
 * quieter.
 *
 * A long message is clipped to `CAP_LINES` lines under a fade, with "Show
 * more" below it; opened, it stays open. Whether it is long is measured — the
 * content's height against the cap — never guessed from its length.
 * `data-askable`: text in here can be asked about in turn (`SelectionAsk`).
