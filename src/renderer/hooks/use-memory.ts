 *  `settleWrite()` invalidates the list — but only once every write this
 *  page currently has in flight has settled, so two overlapping writes (a
 *  toggle, a concurrent delete) collapse into one authoritative re-read
 *  afterwards instead of each firing its own: an earlier one's invalidate
 *  landing while a later one is still uncommitted would read stale server
 *  state and revert the later write right back — the standard TanStack
 *  optimistic-update pattern (`set()`'s own `cancelQueries` guards only a
 *  read already running *when* a write applies; it can't reach a read a
 *  DIFFERENT write's own invalidate starts only afterwards). By the time
 *  every bracketed write has settled, each one's own mutation has already
 *  committed server-side, so the resulting read is authoritative for all
