/**
 * Splits a markdown document into its top-level blocks (a paragraph, a list, a
 * fenced code block, a table, a `$$` block …) so each can be rendered — and
 * memoized — on its own. While a reply streams the text only grows at the end,
 * so every block but the last is byte-for-byte what it was a frame ago and its
 * render can be skipped (strictly: every block but the last two, see below);
 * without this each frame re-ran remark, rehype, KaTeX and the syntax
 * highlighter over the whole answer so far.
 *
 * The blocks are contiguous slices: joined back together they are exactly
 * `src`. Boundaries come from the same parser configuration the renderer uses,
 * so a block never cuts through a construct (a loose list, a fence containing
 * blank lines, a math block).
