 * `compactAfterTurn` can run up to 10 rounds of LLM summarization and routinely
 * outlives a 30-second window). It costs nothing in the happy path —
 * `enqueueAndProcess`'s immediate kick already handles low-latency processing,

/**
 * Reads and processes one batch from a queue. Errors are isolated per
 * message: a handler throwing logs the error and leaves the message alone
 * (pgmq's visibility timeout makes it available again for retry), unless
 * it has already been read `MAX_READ_COUNT` times, in which case it's
 * archived anyway so a permanently-broken payload doesn't retry forever.
 *
 * Known limitation — not every job type can actually trigger this
 * retry/give-up logic, because three of the four handlers in `./handlers`
 * wrap functions that catch and log their own errors internally and never
 * rethrow:
 *
 * - `index-message` — full retry-on-failure. `elasticsearch.indexMessage`
 *   errors propagate, so a real failure is retried up to `MAX_READ_COUNT`
 *   times before being given up on.
 * - `lcm-post-turn` — half-and-half. `trackNewMessages` can throw and
 *   propagate (full retry-on-failure for that half), but `compactAfterTurn`
 *   swallows its own errors internally (best-effort only for that half) —
 *   see `LcmManager.compactAfterTurn` in `../ai/context-management`.
 * - `memory-consolidate` — best-effort only. `runMemoryConsolidation` catches
 *   and logs its own errors and never rethrows, so this handler always
 *   resolves regardless of whether consolidation actually ran successfully.
 *
 * This is a deliberate, accepted tradeoff (ruled on during the job-queue
 * decoupling plan's review), not an oversight: the old fire-and-forget code
 * had identical silent-failure behavior for these job types, and changing
 * `runMemoryConsolidation`/`compactAfterTurn`'s error
 * handling is explicitly out of scope for that plan. The queue still adds
 * real value for these jobs via durability across process restarts — it's
 * only the retry-on-logged-failure behavior that doesn't apply to them.
