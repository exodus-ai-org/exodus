 * Secret values the logger masks in every line it writes (final review M4):
 * an error message that quotes a key — a provider's error text, a request URL
 * with `?key=` — would otherwise land in `~/.exodus/logs` and
 * `GET /api/v1/logs` in plaintext. Fed from where secrets are decrypted (the
 * settings cache fill in `db/queries.ts`, every MCP row read in
 * `db/mcp-queries.ts`), so a value is known before anything can use it.
 * Values are only added for the life of the process — a rotated key's old
 * value keeps being masked. In memory only.
