/**
 * The approval gate for secrets outside Exodus (spec 2026-09-25 §2.5).
 *
 * Exodus's own secrets are defended without exception elsewhere (encrypted at
 * rest, masked by the API). Secrets elsewhere on the machine — SSH keys, cloud
 * credentials, `.env` files — are sometimes exactly what a task needs, so a
 * tool call that touches one is paused and the user decides: `sensitiveTarget`
 * says which calls, `pending-approvals.ts` holds each paused call until a decision
 * (`POST /api/v1/chat/approval`), a timeout or Stop settles it.
 *
 * Some of Exodus's own files are never the user's decision, and a call that
 * touches them is refused without asking: `~/.exodus/lock.dat` (the PIN
 * secret), `~/.exodus/tls/` (the LAN certificate's key), and the raw data —
 * `~/.exodus/database` (PGlite), `~/.exodus/backups` (its archives) and
 * `~/.exodus/analytics` (the DuckDB copy). Those last three are ciphertext
 * only while encryption at rest is on: a backup written before it existed,
 * and every file while `safeStorage` is unavailable, holds keys in plaintext
 * — and no tool has a use for raw database files (chats are read through
 * `lcm_*`). The rest of `~/.exodus` (the chat workspaces, media, logs) stays
 * readable.
 *
 * The terminal rule is a documented heuristic, not a shell parser: a command
 * that names a sensitive path (`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `cd ~/.aws && cat
 * credentials`), reads the keychain or a CLI's stored token (`security
 * find-generic-password`, `gh auth token`), or lists other processes'
 * arguments (`ps -axo args` — an MCP server started with `--api-key …` shows
 * it there) is gated. An obfuscated command gets past it; one that merely
 * mentions `.ssh` in an `echo` is asked about (an accepted false positive).
 *
 * `call_mcp_tool` is gated the same way: every string in its `arguments` is
 * checked as a path and as a command, and a URL at Exodus's own API ports is
 * refused — an MCP filesystem or fetch server is otherwise a side door past
 * both rules.
