/**
 * `web_fetch` (and anything else that fetches a model-chosen URL from this
 * process, such as deep research's own page fetch, if it grows one) must
 * never be able to reach Exodus's own API — a page the model asks to fetch
 * could otherwise read back settings, masked keys, or anything else the
 * loopback or LAN listener serves.
 *
 * The rule is narrower than `safe-fetch.ts`'s "must be public" (used for
 * images): only a URL whose host resolves to loopback, an unspecified
 * address, or one of this machine's own network interfaces — AND whose port
 * is one of the two Exodus listens on (`SERVER_PORT`, `LAN_SERVER_PORT`) —
 * is refused. Everything else on `localhost`, a LAN IP or a private address
 * (another local dev server, an intranet host) stays reachable — that is a
 * supported `web_fetch` use case, not the threat this guards against.
 *
 * `assertNotExodusApi` pre-resolves a host; the connection itself is pinned
 * by `net/pinned-fetch.ts` (`web_fetch`'s built-in loader), which resolves
 * once, judges those addresses with `assertAddressesNotExodusApi` and
 * connects to exactly them — so a DNS answer that rebinds between check and
 * connect is never used. Every redirect hop is re-checked by the caller.
