 * The user-presence capability: a random secret made once per launch, held

 * (`api:presence-token`, `ipc.ts`). Routes that stand for "the user said so"
 * — answering a tool-approval prompt, pairing and managing devices — require
 * it on loopback (`presenceGate`), so a process on this machine that can
 * reach the API but is not the app's window (a `curl` the model runs through
 * the `terminal` tool) cannot approve its own request or pair itself a
 * device. It is never written to disk, logged, put in an SSE event or shown
 * to a tool.
