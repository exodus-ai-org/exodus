 *
 * No `Origin` is every legitimate client but one: exodus-ios, exodus-cli, curl,
 * the API tests, and the packaged renderer itself — measured, not assumed: a
 * `file://` page in Electron sends none, on GET, JSON POST and PUT alike, and
 * is not preflighted. The one client that does send it is the dev renderer,
 * so a dev build accepts exactly that origin (`devOrigin`), not loopback in
 * general: another dev server on this machine — or an XSS on one — is no more
 * entitled to the API than a website is.
 *
 * So `null` is refused (it is what a sandboxed iframe on a hostile page
 * presents), and so is any other scheme: a browser extension, and the artifact
 * sandbox's own `exodus-artifact://`.
