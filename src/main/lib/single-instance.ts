/**
 * One Exodus process per data directory.
 *
 * PGlite has no cross-process lock: a second process on the same
 * `~/.exodus/database` corrupts it. The second instance did fail — but only at
 * binding port 60223, by which point it had opened the database, run the
 * migrations and written the startup clean-ups. So the lock is taken by
 * `db/db.ts`, before it constructs PGlite: no lock, no database.
 *
 * It is Electron's own lock (kernel-backed, keyed on `userData`, released when
 * the holder dies however it dies). Dev and packaged builds share `userData`,
 * so it holds between them too. It does not cover universal-client, which has a
 * `userData` of its own.
 *
 * A second launch has two very different causes, told apart by whether the
 * holder answers:
 * - the app is already running → the holder acknowledges and raises its
 *   window; this process exits at once.
 * - the app is on its way out (quit, then reopened straight away — closing
 *   PGlite cleanly takes up to 5s) → a quitting holder stays silent; this
 *   process waits for the lock and then starts normally, instead of the launch
 *   silently doing nothing.
